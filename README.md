## Introduction

Echo is designed to streamline the process of reading and writing files across
different applications. By leveraging WebSockets, it ensures real-time
communication and efficient task management. The worker-stealer pattern allows
for dynamic distribution of tasks, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

## Features

-   **Asynchronous Operations**:

Utilizes asynchronous functions to handle file operations, ensuring non-blocking
execution.

-   **Worker-Stealer Pattern**:

Implements a dynamic task distribution mechanism to balance the workload across
multiple workers.

-   **WebSocket Communication**:

Facilitates real-time communication between different components of the system.

-   **Parallel Queues**:

Manages tasks using parallel queues to enhance performance and efficiency.

## Installation

To get started with Echo, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone ssh://git@github.com/CodeEditorLand/Echo.git
    cd Echo
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4. **Build the TypeScript project**:
    ```bash
    pnpm run prepublishOnly
    ```

## Usage

## Architecture

### Worker-Stealer Pattern

The worker-stealer pattern is implemented to dynamically distribute tasks among
available workers. This ensures that no single worker is overloaded while others
remain idle. Tasks are placed in a shared queue, and workers can "steal" tasks
from each other to balance the workload.

### WebSocket Communication

WebSockets are used to facilitate real-time communication between the Tauri
application, Sun, and River. This ensures that file operations are executed
promptly and efficiently.

### Asynchronous and Parallel Queues

Echo uses asynchronous functions and parallel queues to manage tasks. This
ensures that file operations do not block the main execution thread, enhancing
the overall performance and responsiveness of the system.

### Code Structure

-   **Interface**:

Defines the structure of the response object and the main asynchronous function
for handling responses.

-   **Worker**:

Contains the implementation of the worker-stealer pattern and the task queue
management.

-   **Main**:

The entry point of the Rust binaries, responsible for reading configuration
files and setting up the environment.
